      <title>Neural Directed Evolution for Protein Sequence Optimization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search-based Directed Evolution framework for sequence optimization which utilizes upper-confidence bound (UCB) algorithm that effectively search for closely related protein mutants with high fitness values and relatively low mutation counts. We formalized a bandit model for Directed Evolution as an initial population evolves via uniform mutation and directed recombination of parent sequences. In replacement of real-world wet-lab experiments and measurements, we simulate the ground-truth protein fitness landscape with a pre-trained black-box model and use TAPE embedding inputs to simulate and train the black-box oracle model. We evaluate the proposed MCTS-based DE on benchmark protein sequence datasets including GB1, AAV, and WW domain, and our proposed algorithm achieves substantial improvement over baseline algorithms including AdaLead, DyNA PPO and PEX.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automaton Distillation for Non-Markovian Knowledge Transfer in Deep RL</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Existing methods in knowledge transfer for reinforcement learning as policy distillation suffer from two weaknesses. First, the learned policies exhibit poor generalization on tasks outside the training distribution; second, existing methods usually rely on the Markovian assumptions to reach good performance. To mitigate these issues, we propose automaton distillation for non-Markovian knowledge transfer. Our proposed algorithm first trains a teacher agent using standard Deep Q-Learning and then distills teacher Q-value estimates into student model learned in the target environment. We experimented on various grid-world environments and demonstrated better performance and faster convergence compared to existing baseline methods.&lt;/p&gt;
